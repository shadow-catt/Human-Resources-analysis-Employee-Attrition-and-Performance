# Human Resources analysis Employee Attrition and Performance
Group project for the  Introduction to Business Data Analytics
## CONTENT
The aim of the report is to find out what factors contribute to the attrition of IBM 
employees. Firstly, we use Chebyshev's inequality to evaluate the distribution of each variable. 
Then we use decision models to predict whether employees want to leave the company and 
give partial advice accordingly. Through linear regression and Logistic Regression, we find 
that over time, the total working year, and monthly income are essential factors in the departure 
of IBM employees and general advice is given accordingly
